This is a gimmick asset for VRChat worlds which shows everyone's timezones, approximate location based on the timezone and their local time in the same world instance on a hologram earth, it is powered by UdonSharp. Have a remind that this asset is only tested for desktop clients, even logic that targeted to Quest clients are coded, there is no guarantee works perfectly to Quest users.

Here is a proof-of-concept world that included this asset, you may want to have a look:
